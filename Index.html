# Caring First Website

Static website for Caring First — ready for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Files
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, `careers.html`, `faq.html`, `contact.html`
- `styles.css`, `script.js`
- `assets/` (logo and images)
- `.nojekyll` (ensures GitHub Pages serves files as-is)
- `README.md` (this file)

## Deploy on GitHub Pages (Steps)
1. Create a repo named `caring-first-website` (Public).
2. Upload all files/folders from this directory to the repo root.
3. In the repo, go to **Settings › Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Branch** to `main` and **Folder** to `/ (root)`, then **Save**.
5. Wait 1–2 minutes. Your site will appear at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/caring-first-website/`

## HubSpot Forms (Contact & Careers)
- In HubSpot: **Marketing › Lead Capture › Forms › Create Embedded form**.
- Add your fields (Name, Email, Phone, Message, File Upload for Contact; Name, Email, Phone, Resume Upload for Careers).
- Click **Publish**, copy the **Embed code**.

Paste your embed code into:
- `contact.html` where you see: `<!-- HubSpot Form Embed Placeholder -->`
- `careers.html` where you see: `<!-- HubSpot Form Embed Placeholder -->`

Example placement:
```html
<!-- HubSpot Form Embed Placeholder -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://js.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js"></script>
<script>
  hbspt.forms.create({
    region: "na1",
    portalId: "YOUR_PORTAL_ID",
    formId: "YOUR_FORM_ID"
  });
</script>
```

## Custom Domain (Optional)
